F8
==

This is support for the Fairchild F8. The syntax used for naken_asm
has been modernized a little bit. It should support all the old syntax
if this is really desired, but it's recommended not to use that.

Examples Of Changes
===================

When dealing with the ISAR register, the old syntax used S, U, and D where
S means the ISAR register itself, U means use the ISAR register and then
increment it by 1, and D means use the ISAR register and decrement by 1.

naken_asm will also support:

S: ISAR
U: ISAR+ and S+
D: ISAR- and S-

The disassembly will show ISAR, ISAR+, ISAR- by default just to make
things more clear.
